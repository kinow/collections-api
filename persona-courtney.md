## About Courtney

I develop web and phone apps commercially for clients in NZ and internationally, so I work with APIs from a wide range of industries.  
Due to commercial deadlines I don't have enough time to really understand the APIs (or the business models behind them) -- I tend to only learn enough about the APIs so that I can integrate their processes or content into my software.

## Attributes

* High tech literacy
* Not familiar with Te Papa or the GLAM sector
* Pragmatic approach, so prepared to work around issues provided it is cost-effective

## Examples

* Classroom games for the education market
* Mobile apps for tourists from Asia to rate locations and activities

## My needs

* Documentation that doesn't assume a contextual understanding of Te Papa or its collections
* Clear details on media licencing and service levels
* Real-time querying and retrieval to provide relevant images to my app's users
* Small payloads that are friendly to phone apps (low bandwidth, memory/CPU/battery consumption constraints)
* High availability as I may be charging end-users
* Able to cache copies of metadata and/or media assets, e.g. to serve from a central host alongside other cached content 
* Write access for personalisation & end-user contributions
* Formats/protocols/tools: JSON, Hypermedia, SDKs

## My pain points

* I'm frustrated by APIs and data that take a lot of time to understand.  Often I end up having long email conversations with API producers to clarify what certain fields mean or what are the range of possible values for a field
* I'm frustrated by APIs that are unstable –- I deal with many different APIs and too much of my time is spent fixing data inconsistencies (e.g. text in numeric fields), undocumented changes, or version upgrades.
