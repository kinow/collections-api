## About Dan

I am a developer in a medium-sized public institution (in the heritage, science, or art sector).  
I am committed to helping progress my sector, so I contribute my time and energy to the collaborative development of new and emerging IT standards and solutions.

## Attributes

* API early adopter
* High tech literacy
* Familiar with Te Papa or the GLAM sector
* Committed to Linked Data and the Semantic Web
* Passionate about the 'greater good' above solving their immediate issues

## Examples

* "I am creating a JavaScript widget that GLAMs can place on their website to automatically search and combine Linked Data metadata to display images from around the country that are relevant to the topic of that webpage"
* "We use Jena internally for our specimens, so it's easiest if I can connect directly to a SPARQL endpoint to combine it with local queries."
* Te Papa sector partners, e.g. Google Art Project, Wikimedia, Birds Online, and Nature Watch.

## My needs

* Real-time querying and retrieval of Te Papa metadata and media assets as part of a wider aggregation of collections across my sector
* Access to well-structured metadata that is easy to link/match with other datasets
* Write access for personalisation or end-user contributions
* Formats/protocols/tools: 
  * GLAM/Linked Data: RDF/XML, JSON-LD, SPARQL, Linked Data Fragments, OAI-PMH
  * Biodiversity: XML, CSV, ISO 19139 (GIS vocabularies), DarwinCore
  * Programming language libraries

## My pain points

* I find my task Is harder when I'm calling multiple APIs but some don't conform to best practice or international standards
* I'm frustrated by APIs that are hard to integrate with my system, e.g. can't query using industry-standard identifiers
* I'm frustrated when I can't openly share API deep links or their content with other colleagues in my sector, e.g. a key/password is required or there are restrictive licences
* I feel isolated when an API is closed source or doesn't have a community around it.  I want to be able to report bugs and discover how other API consumers got around the issue
