## About onsite developer

I am a developer designing physical experiences for Te Papa onsite visitors.  

I am focussed on wider applications for a single audience or outcome. 
My output may include a physical presence, e.g. kiosks or gesture-controlled interfaces.

## Examples

* Pounamu Taonga interactive: visitors can browse collection objects
* Welcome interactive: visitors enter where they are from to see people and topics from there
* Mahuki innovation hub participant

</div>

My needs

* Smaller sets of content
* Higher security clearance, e.g. access to non-public data
* Write access for personalisation & end-user contributions, and possibly to the collection itself (e.g. visitors upload their images into the collection)
* Integration with other Te Papa systems and APIs, as part of maintaining longer-term relationships with visitors
