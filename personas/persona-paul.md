## About Paul

I am responsible for visitors' digital access to my institution's collections (in the heritage, science, or art sector).  

My focus is on outputs that improve the quality of access, e.g. more content, a more visual experience, or improved searchability.

## Attributes

* Medium tech literacy
* Familiar with Te Papa or the GLAM sector
* Passionate about using technology solutions to improve access for their end-users, but may have limited opportunities due to their level of expertise or workplace environment
* Comfortable if the API integrates with their specialist systems, otherwise find it quite challenging

## Examples

* "Many of our catalogue records only have a handful of fields filled in, so I want to find and import standard vocabulary terms and descriptions."
* "I am importing thumbnails and links to war-related images relevant to my library's region into our WWI commemoration website. The website system only imports CSV files -- I download CSV files, massage them in a spreadsheet, then export a clean CSV to import."

## My needs

* Batch (non-real-time) querying and retrieval of Te Papa metadata and media assets, either using scripts or downloads for local processing
* Formats/protocols/tools: CSV/TSV, JSON, JSON-LD, programming language libraries

## My pain points

* It can be tricky to implement solutions in my organisation's environment due to restrictive corporate IT policies or vendor lock-in, so I'm stuck if an API doesn't provide the data format or support the programming language that my organisation or vendor mandates
* Some of the tools I use are older or 'lite' versions with limited functionality so they have difficulties dealing with modern APIs, e.g. they can't send/read API keys, hypermedia, etc. via HTTP headers 
* Downloading data can take a lot longer if I have to run thousands of extra calls just to add in related resource labels, e.g. when the record only includes the IDs for related subject terms
