## About Rebecca

1. I am a 'digital humanist' academic researcher.  Increasingly I am expected to include data analysis as part of my process.  Mostly I perform speculative investigation using a variety of algorithms over dumps of metadata or media assets to reveal new patterns or connections.
2. I am a biodiversity scientist.  I work with specimen datasets from around the world in specialist software that plots & analyses environmental sensor and specimen collection data on maps.

## Attributes

* Medium tech literacy
* Familiar with Te Papa but not the GLAM sector
* Passionate about their specialist subject area rather than the technology itself
* Has developed proficiency in a couple of tools (e.g. R and Python), but would never call themselves a 'developer'

## Examples

* "I am deriving ORB image descriptors (using the pastec.io library) from object and artwork image collection dumps to identify similar items held in institutions around the world."
* "I am undertaking 'distant reading' to explore the differences between the colonial wars in NZ and Australia by running topic modelling and network analysis over sets of downloaded data records."
* "I am aggregating regional specimen collection datasets to assist district council environmental planning. I usually download datasets from public environmental registers."

## My needs

* Prefer to access via human-friendly interfaces (e.g. list of datasets available to download) or via intermediary services (e.g. biodiversity dataset aggregators), but willing to negotiate machine interfaces to get to the data needed
* Formats/protocols/tools: 
  * Humanities: CSV/TSV, OAI-PMH, programming language libraries
  * Science: XML, CSV, DarwinCore, ISO 19139 (GIS) based vocabularies and systems

## My pain points

* Sometimes I have to abandon a data source if its range of programming language libraries or output formats doesn't include the only one that I have some proficiency in
* I am frustrated when dataset identifiers don't align as it slows down combining the data from multiple sources to get an aggregate picture
* It can get tricky keeping downloaded datasets in sync when I can't filter for recently added/changed records or the OAI-PMH implementation doesn't notify deletions
